# radius-circumference-calculator
Just a simple page to calculate the radius of a circle from its circumference, or vice-versa as needed.
To spruce up the calculator, I'm including a diagram of a circle with the radius highlighted. I'm aware that there is a way with CSS to get dynamically generated text to go around a circle, but from what I've read it seems to be too much work for too few browsers.
